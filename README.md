Text-to-Speech Converter – Accessible Web Utility
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (SpeechSynthesis API)

The Text-to-Speech Converter is a web-based application developed to enhance digital accessibility and user interaction through voice output. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project utilizes the browser’s native SpeechSynthesis API, allowing users to input text into a simple interface and hear it read aloud in real time. This application demonstrates a practical implementation of web accessibility, offering support for users who may have visual impairments, reading difficulties, or simply prefer auditory content.

The frontend design prioritizes clarity and ease of use, with a minimalist layout styled using clean CSS to maintain focus on functionality. The interface is fully responsive, adapting fluidly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices to provide a consistent experience regardless of screen size. The user is guided by clear input prompts, and interactive elements respond smoothly to actions, contributing to an intuitive and polished user experience.

From a technical perspective, JavaScript is used to interact with the SpeechSynthesis API, enabling dynamic control over speech playback. Users can trigger speech output with a single button click, and the code is structured to allow easy future enhancements such as voice selection, rate adjustment, or pitch control.

This project helped deepen understanding of browser-based APIs, asynchronous interaction, and accessibility-first design. It also reflects a strong emphasis on user-centered development and the importance of inclusive digital tools in today’s web ecosystem. Overall, the Text-to-Speech Converter is a simple yet impactful application that bridges technology and accessibility in a practical, approachable way.
